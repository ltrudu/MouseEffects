## Implementation Notes

### Complexity Levels
- **Low**: Simple particle systems or basic shaders, 1-2 days
- **Medium**: Moderate shader complexity, custom animations, 3-5 days
- **High**: Complex algorithms, physics simulations, or advanced graphics, 1-2 weeks

### Technical Considerations
- All effects should support HDR output
- Lazy loading for performance
- Configurable triggers (mouse move, clicks)
- Adjustable intensity and speed parameters
- Consistent UI pattern following existing plugins

### Priority Suggestions
1. **Pixie Dust** - Simple, universally appealing
2. **Matrix Rain** - Iconic, medium complexity
3. **Neon Glow** - Synthwave aesthetic is popular
4. **Black Hole** - Impressive visual impact
5. **Butterflies** - Nature theme, challenging but rewarding
